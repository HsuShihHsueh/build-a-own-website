##The main idea
Since there is no comfortable app or website to calculate parallel circuit(//), 
so why don't we build a own website to deal this the problem ?
the process can divide into three subprocess：
```
1. write a calculate in 【HTML】 + 【Javascript】
2. get a free website server from 【000webhost】
3. get a free website domain from 【freenom】
```

## STEP 1： write a calculate in 【HTML】 + 【Javascript】
Since HTML only provide a interface to display thoe code, it needs Javascript to make the program works.<br>
The whole code is on ```cal_v2.html```<br>

## STEP 2： get a free website server from 【000webhost】
<b>000webhost</b> provide a free website server that you can pop code or even data library on it.<br>
First, create a account.<br>

Seocnd, <br>

## STEP 3： get a free website domain from 【freenom】
Since the website link which 000webhost provides is too long and hard memroize.<br>
<b>Freenom</b> provide a free website domain such as ```.ga``` or ```.tk```  ...<br>

First,  create a account and sign in.<br>

Second, choose the domian you want.<br>

Third,  go to： freenom/my domain/Management Tools/Use custom nameservers and type
  Nameserver 1<br>
  ```ns01.000webhost.com```<br>
  Nameserver 2<br>
  ```ns02.000webhost.com```<br>
